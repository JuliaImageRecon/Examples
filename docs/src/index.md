# JuliaImageRecon Examples

## Overview

[https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon/Examples](https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon/Examples)

Image reconstruction examples
in the
[Julia language](https://julialang.org),
compiled using
[Literate](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl)
and
[Documenter](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl).

## Getting started

* Install Julia from
[https://julialang.org](https://julialang.org/downloads)

* Select an editor, preferably with Julia integration, such as
[VSCode]( https://www.julia-vscode.org)
or [vim](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vim)
perhaps with
[tmux](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/julia-vim-tutorial-for-newbies/36636)

* Peruse the reconstruction examples here.
If your browser window is wide enough,
you should see a menu to the left.
If your window is narrow,
you should see a
[hamburger menu button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button)
that will toggle open the examples sidebar.

* View the excellent documentation at
[JuliaImages](https://juliaimages.org)

See the menu
for specific examples.

These examples show you Julia code
and the corresponding output
in an HTML format suitable for viewing
in a web browser
without installing *any* software.

You could cut and paste portions of that Julia code
into the
[Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL),
but that becomes tedious.

Instead,
click on the "Edit on GitHub" link
(in the upper right, with
[github icon](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png)),
where you can then download the entire Julia code file
that generated any of these examples.

For example,
the code for the
[NUFFT example](https://juliaimagerecon.github.io/Examples/mri/1-nufft)
is at
[this url](https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon/Examples/blob/main/docs/lit/mri/1-nufft.jl).

After downloading such a file such as
[1-nufft.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon/Examples/blob/main/docs/lit/mri/1-nufft.jl),
you can run it
by typing
`include("1-nufft.jl")`
at the Julia REPL.
